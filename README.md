## Introduction
This application was built as a part of the course ["Build and Deploy a React Cryptocurrency App and Master Redux Toolkit in One Video"](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9DDX3US3kss) from the YouTube channel [JavaScript Mastery](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCmXmlB4-HJytD7wek0Uo97A).

As an extra bonus, I also added TypeScript to the application and improved the css a little bit.
